## Description

Nowadays a lot of people use only card payments and do not hold cash on a daily basis. At the same time paying by card might take some time and effort to connect with the bank, withdraw the money, and print the payment receipt. Blockchain with its technologies comes to solve it.

The goal is to implement the application, which can substitute payments during the event, which allows to avoid cash and card payment issues. Thanks to tokens and smart contracts user should buy all tokens, which he needs straight in the app and if there is a need to buy extra tokens, the app is always available for that. When the user, for example, is happy to use a goods token representing food, then the user can easily do it through the app in a few clicks and once the token has been used, the responsible entity should make the token invalid and in such case give a portion of food to the user.
